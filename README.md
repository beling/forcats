A game for cats where they can catch a light!

Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language with [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) library.

Cats can play on-line at: http://cats.w8.pl/

Note: Cats like mice, but they don't use computer ones very well.
This is why I recommend playing on touch panel devices such as mobile phones or tablets.
